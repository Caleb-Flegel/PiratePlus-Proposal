Matt's feedback:
  Matt wanted us to put the welcome page first instead of showing the home page. He pressed the log out button, and he couldn't
  find a way to log back into the app. He also wanted a smoother transition between the welcome page and the home page so people
  could realistically create an account and have everything flow nicely.

Irene's feedback:
  When Irene tested the app, she also wanted us to make a welcome page. She understands we could not figure out how to make the
  welcome page first, but she wants us to find a way to create a smooth flow between the welcome page and the home page. She
  recommends adding a social section for college students to connect with other students and make new friends. Finally, she wants
  us to check the buttons and make sure all of them function properly.
  
Isaac's feedback:
  Isaac said the University name is not clear on the login page and wants us to separate first name and last name. He also thinks
  the sign in button should be bigger. Isaac said our prototype had good UI and liked the flow of it overall. He believes that he
  would use the app.

Michael and Ron's feedback:
  Michael and Ron also said the login button is too small. They thought we had a good design, but we should have made the page
  with darker, more Whitworth colors. They like the simplicity of the app and want us to keep it that way as we continue to develop
  our project. They recommend that we add an intramural section to the events page and would use our app when we release it!

Brady's Feedback:
  Brady also enjoyed our visual design a lot. He said unlike other Whitworth apps like HonorFollowServe, our prototype actually felt like a Whitworth app. In addition, Brady thought that the layout was intuitive and didn't have any trouble navigating throughout the app. He also liked the system for ridesharing and events where a simplified table is shown for options, but if you click on an entry, you can see a page with more details. One piece of advice from his is that users should be able to swipe from the left to open it, instead of just using the hamburger menu button. In addition, he suggested that users should be able to tap on the title/logo to back home as well.
