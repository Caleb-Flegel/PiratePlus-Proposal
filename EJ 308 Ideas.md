EJ 308/214 Room Suggestions

# Art Murals
 - we want the art students at Whitworth to come into the rooms and paint murals on the walls. We would want them to pain a nature theme to give the walls more life. If the walls had murals on them, it would give the room color and create a pleasant environment. This could become an opportunity for art students to make the art their senior capstone project
 - Art right above the door

# INSPIRING QUOTES
- Inspirational quotes can help students who are in Eric Johnston often to find the motivation to finish their projects, especially when they are encountering challenges with coding. Quotes motivate students to maintain their resilience and finish what they have started.


# More outlets 
 - More outlets can help people can charge their devices, specifically phones and laptops, if they are working and have mulitple windows open. If students are studying in these rooms with abundant outlets, they could also charge their phones, Bluetooth headphones, or other devices so they can multitask.

# New blinds
- The blinds on the windows look depressing, so maybe the school could change the blinds in the rooms. We want newer blinds to be implemented so people have ease during lockdowns. (blind sliders)

# Monitor Arms
 - Monitor arms would improve the versatility/productivity potential of the desktop work spaces
   - For example, students may prefer to code with one or both of the monitors in a vertical orientation

# Laptop docks
 - This would incentivize students to work in the computer labs more, especially if they mostly use their laptops to code
   - If docks were set up at all the workstations that charged and provided a network connection for laptops would be very useful for students
   - If more people worked inside the computer labs, the docks may help cause more collaboration between students
   - Additionally, if paired with the monitor arms, the quality of the workspaces would improve by a lot

# plants into the room, fake succulents
- plants add life into the room and creates a positive environment

# squishmallows (beanbags or big plushies)
 - Squishmallows are cute and soft, which can add more life in the room and comfort students. Big pillows (especially during finals week when people are constantly studying in the room for hours)
 - Squishmallows are cute and soft,

# better chairs (because of back support)
- when people are sitting at chairs that often have no back support for long periods of time, 

# whiteboards like ROB 210
- Sliding whiteboards could give students more room to design code and allows them to save and reference their work without erasing anything. It can also help other peers when they are checking work to catch errors in code.

# STRESS RELIEVING TOYS (figet toys)
- Squishies (stress balls) can be beneficial for people who need to let their anger out. When people want to destress without screaming or punching something, they could squeeze squishies as an outlet for anger.
