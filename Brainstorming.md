Document which will contain our ideas on how to solve the problem we are working on.

Problem: Whitworth students don't have one place where where they can find useful non-academic information/services
Solution: Develop an app that will serve as a hub for a lot of these services (see below)
How to test: perfect the design using polling and prototyping software like JustInMind. Poll peers on what they would want to see in a non-academic app. Also find out from peers why apps like HonorFollowServe are not often used. 

Problem: College student mental health is suffering
Solution: Develop a daily mental health check-in app/page which will help people manage their emotions by giving them mental health resources and methods for tracking their mood. 
How we are testing it: We will first test out the idea using something like JustInMind to gain insights on the app design. We will also develop a code based prototype which will help test the functionality of the page.

Problem: Students without cars and out-of-state students sometimes struggle to go places when needed, such as going home for breaks
Solution: Develop an app where students offering rides can be connected with students needing rides. There will also be a system where students offering rides can request a payment if desired.
How we are going to test it: We will use JustinMind (or a similar app) to demonstrate the design of the app. We may also do a dry run using a prebuilt system like google forms that will act similarly to the what we envision the app to be like.

Problem: Whitworth students often are unaware of the events happening around campus
Solution: People can post events that are visible to anybody potentially interested in attending. These events could include ASWU/Univeristy events, sporting events, primetimes, club events, and more.
How are we going to test it: We can test the design using prototyping apps like JustInMind. We will ask people about features of this portion of the app that will actually make them use it. 

Problem: It is inconvenient for students to check how many flex dollars/swipes they have left. Non-local students and families are unaware of tasty food options
Solution: develop a database of local food places which serves as a recommendation list which includes info like food type, price, and store hours. We also plan to display the number of flex dollars and 
How we are going to test it: We can test out design using prototyping sites like JustInMind. We can poll peers on what sort of information they would want when getting food recommendations.
