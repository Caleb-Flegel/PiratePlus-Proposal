            <h2>Kyle Marquez</h2>
            <p>First, we decided to share our app idea with Kyle Marquez, a current sophomore at Whitworth University. Kyle wanted us to know about the Honor Follow Serve app taht Whitworth has released, and he mentioned that few people currently use the app to upload event information. He warned us about the low engagement we may encounter for the events section of the app. Instead of an evens section, Kyle suggested to make the fourth section seomthing fun, such as a daily WHitowrth random fact or a funny joke.</p>
