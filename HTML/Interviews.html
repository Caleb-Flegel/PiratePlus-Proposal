        <h1>Interviews</h1>
        <div class="interview">
            <h2>Kyle Marquez</h2>
            <p>First, we decided to share our app idea with Kyle Marquez, a current sophomore at Whitworth University. Kyle wanted us to
                know about the Honor Follow Serve app that Whitworth has released, and he mentioned that few people currently use the app to
                upload event information. He warned us about the low engagement we may encounter for the events section of the app. Instead
                of an evens section, Kyle suggested to make the fourth section something fun, such as a daily Whitowrth random fact
                or a funny joke. He also suggests to use the mental health check-in as an adrenaline booster for people to complete their
                section individually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <h2>Brielle Schmekel</h2>
            <p>Next, we interviewed Brielle Schmekel, a first-year student at Whitworth University. Even though Brielle lives in Washington,
                she told us she would use the rideshare app because it is difficult for her to find rides back to Wenatchee. She advised us to monitor
                our engagement once we release Pirate Plus and make it trendy to motivate people to use it every day. She liked the mental health idea
                because it would give people a place to share their emotions and allow people to be vulnerable with the app. Brielle also recommends
                to send out a daily notification at a random time for people to log on and allow people to post pictures on Pirate Plus, giving them
                the opportunity to reflect on their lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <h2>Auli'i Peahi</h2>
            <p>In addition, we shared the concept of Pirate Plus with Auli'i Peahi, another first-year student at Whitworth University. Auli'i
                pictures herself using the rideshare section the most because she does not live in Washington and often struggles to find rides to and
                from the airport. She would also use the rideshare for grocery shopping because it is safer for her than taking the bus everywhere. Since
                she does not have a car, the food recommendation section of Pirate Plus will be difficult for her to use, but she would use it if drivers
                offered to take people to food places. Auli'i also warned us that some people, including herself, may prefer internalizing their emotions,
                so she suggests to add the outreach information to the mental health check-in section of the app for people who enjoy expressing their
                emotions. Finally, she likes the events section of the app because it is challenging for her to keep track of the events happening around
                campus, and the events online could help her to access the events easily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <h2>Alisa Bibaj</h2>
            <p>We also interviewed Alisa, a first-year student at Whitworth University. Alisa lives on the other side of Washington, and she shares
                the common struggle of finding rides back home; however, she suggested that we should pay drivers to take people around and match drivers to
                students based on personalities. She also mentioned the other platforms Whitworth uses to notify students of events (Honor Follow Serve and
                Handshake), but she appreciates the idea because those platforms can become confusing for her at times. In addition, she recommends having a
                customizable notifications feature for the mental health check-ins because she feels some people could become annoyed by constant daily
                notifications, which will make certain people resent the app. If users can control the frequency of notifications, the mental health check-in
                will not feel like a chore people have to complete. She supports the food recommendations section of Pirate Plus, especially because she will
                know where to eat with her family when they come to visit her.</p>

        <div class="interview">
            <h2>Ellie Huser</h2>
            <p>Finally, we asked Ellie, a first-year student at Whitworth University, about her thoughts on Pirate Plus. Ellie appreciates the rideshare aspect
                because she lives out of state and needs to find ways to get to the airport. She also likes the rideshare part because it will be cheaper and
                less creepy than taking a normal Uber. She recommends to add a description page so we can match people who have similar interests and personalities
                to catch rides together. She feels like it covers the main issues around campus and makes people's lives easier.</p>
