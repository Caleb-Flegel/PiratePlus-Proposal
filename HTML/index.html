        <h1>About the Project</h1>

        <div class="detail">
            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>We seek to create an app for college students that serves as a comprehensive resource for non-academic needs. We will develop a Whitworth-specific version of the app, 
                called Pirate Plus. In addition, this app will be able to scale to include other university-specific versions, think "Bulldog Plus" or "Cougar Plus". Pirate Plus will
                serve as a facilitator of cooperation and community between students. </p>

            <p>The app will have four main focuses: decentralized ridesharing, mental health check-ins, food resources, and an event board.
            <ul>
                <li>The ridesharing portion of the app will allow students to post their trips, allowing for students who need a ride to join. For example, if a student is returning 
                    home to Seattle for break and has extra space, they will be able to post about it. Then a student who doesn't have a car would be able to join in exchange for
                    something like gas money.</li>
                <li>The mental health portion of the app will ask student to take voluntary daily quizzes which evaluate their mental health. The trends of the responses will be used
                    to help students with their mental health. For example, if a student reports that they are feeling depressed for a few days, the app may recommend that they talk
                    to a campus counselor and provide ways to contact the counseling office.</li>
                <li>The events portion of the app will be a centralized place for event posting. Campus organizations will be to post events including details such as time and description.
                    Potential events may include club meetings, primetimes, or athletic events. In addition, we plan to include general Spokane-area events and incorporate it with the
                    ridesharing portion of the app. For example, if there is an art show downtown, someone may be able to post that they are offering rides to the event.</li>
                <li>Finally, the food resource section of the app will include useful information about student meal plans and food locations. Specifically, a student would be able to see
                    the amount of flex-dollars and meal swipes they have left and see the daily hours of all of Whitworth's food locations. </li>
            </ul>
